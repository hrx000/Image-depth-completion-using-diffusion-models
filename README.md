# Image-depth-completion-using-diffusion-models
1.Aims at predicting dense pixel-wise depth from a sparse map captured from a depth sensor.
2.Recent successes is dominated by deep learning based solution.

3.Kinect has small holes and the map captured by LiDAR is significantly more sparse
4.Affinity  matrix

5.RGB guided depth completion.
6.Late fusion model

7.DE can be divide in 3 classes-
       (a) Depth estimation from RGB image directly
       (b) Estimating depth from an RGB image with sparse 
           (c) DC by RGB and inaccuarate depth.
